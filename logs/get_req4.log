===============================

Your task is to write one clear, concise, and complete natural language requirement that accurately describes the structure, function, behavior, or purpose of the focus_element based on its structure and relations.

The requirement must:
- Begin with a clear, specific action verb.
- Be unambiguous, unique, and self-contained.
- Include enough context to be understood independently.
- Avoid using modeling-specific terms (e.g., "block", "property").
- Preserve traceability to the SysML model's structure and meaning.

Only output the final requirement sentence. Do not include any labels, explanations, or commentary.

Your task is to write one clear, concise, and complete natural language requirement that accurately describes the structure, function, behavior, or purpose of the focus_element based on its structure and relations.

The requirement must:
- Begin with a clear, specific action verb.
- Be unambiguous, unique, and self-contained.
- Include enough context to be understood independently.
- Avoid using modeling-specific terms (e.g., "block", "property").
- Preserve traceability to the SysML model's structure and meaning.

Only output the final requirement sentence. Do not include any labels, explanations, or commentary.

You are a systems engineer with expertise in requirements analysis and system modeling.

Below is a structured XMI snippet exported from MagicDraw, representing a SysML model element of type "State Machine Diagram-StateMachine". SysML elements are implemented as UML base elements, extended with SysML-specific stereotypes.

The data includes the main model element (focus_elements) and its contextual elements (related_elements), encoded in raw XMI format.

Below is a structured XMI snippet exported from MagicDraw, representing a SysML model element of type "Package Diagram-Package". SysML elements are implemented as UML base elements, extended with SysML-specific stereotypes.

The data includes the main model element (focus_elements) and its contextual elements (related_elements), encoded in raw XMI format.

focus_elements:

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  










===============================

related_elements:

===============================

Your task is to write one clear, concise, and complete natural language requirement that accurately describes the structure, function, behavior, or purpose of the focus_element based on its structure and relations.

The requirement must:
- Begin with a clear, specific action verb.
- Be unambiguous, unique, and self-contained.
- Include enough context to be understood independently.
- Avoid using modeling-specific terms (e.g., "block", "property").
- Preserve traceability to the SysML model's structure and meaning.

Only output the final requirement sentence. Do not include any labels, explanations, or commentary.

Your task is to write one clear, concise, and complete natural language requirement that accurately describes the structure, function, behavior, or purpose of the focus_element based on its structure and relations.

The requirement must:
- Begin with a clear, specific action verb.
- Be unambiguous, unique, and self-contained.
- Include enough context to be understood independently.
- Avoid using modeling-specific terms (e.g., "block", "property").
- Preserve traceability to the SysML model's structure and meaning.

Only output the final requirement sentence. Do not include any labels, explanations, or commentary.
