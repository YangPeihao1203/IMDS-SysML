No explanation.\n\nRequirement:\nThe spacecraft shall initiate Earth observation data collection when a target region enters its field of view.\n\nReference Model:\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nGenerated Model:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Region in View\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nRating: '

prompt2: text='You are reviewing SysML models for alignment with requirements.\nRate how well the Generated model aligns with the Reference model in terms of:\n1.
